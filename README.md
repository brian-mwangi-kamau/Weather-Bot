This is a __bot__ built in Python with tweepy. It is expected to be posting weather updates on __Twitter/X__ every day, multiple times and specific time, all which will be decided as it is developed.

Besides having a bot, there might be a webapp for the same, where users can get statistics on weather updates, either by searching with their location, or through a __chatbot__.

The proposed name for the bot will be __Majira__, which is a Swahili name translating to __'season'__.
